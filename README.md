# 🍌 Banana

**Banana** is a flexible, high-performance solver for Bananagrams-style word grids. Designed as a platform for experimenting with constraint propagation and search algorithms, it supports pluggable constraint systems, optimized search strategies, and parameter tuning.

This project was built for fun — and as an excuse to dive deep into solver architecture and algorithmic optimization.

- ⚙️ **Flexible search engine**  
  Mix and match DFS, backtracking, greedy, and custom search algorithms.

- 🧠 **Parameter optimization**  
  Automatically tunes search weights and heuristics to balance speed and quality.

- ✅ **Tested and reliable**  
  Complete unit test suite and fast iterative feedback loop for development.
